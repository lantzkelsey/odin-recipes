                <li>1&sol;2 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons dried basil &lpar;Optional&rpar;</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano &lpar;Optional&rpar;</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>2 cups dried mafalda noodles</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
                <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
                <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
